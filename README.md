# Wow hunter auto play
 This is my attempts to learn Lua and interact with the WoW api in 2.4.3 TBC

## Design
I was thinking this should be a Macro but It may be better as a Addon - Addon sounds hard I do Macro for now


### compile_lua.py
compile_lua.py will target a lua file and spit it out in one line to easy copy and paste into WoW
This can be done manually but python is known...



### Notify_pet_happy.lua
This will notify me when pet is unhappy, and spam me when pet is low on happy so I feeds and pet doesnt run away.
    
It should ideally glow when I have enabled it on the hotbar
It should be a Macro
Then spam every 10 seconds when on Yellow happy
Then every one second on 1 happy
It shoud not feed it for me - i feed the kitty
